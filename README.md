Recently it has become apparant that 9gag is plagued by bots and spammers, so I created this simple extention to remove them from our feeds.\
This extention doesn't block any account but simply hides the posts.

[Download on the Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/9gag-post-filter/ajkipkkhchaaccpbpkclolpebkgbmodl)



## Features

- Show days next to the username on every post
- Hide users with less than X amount of days
- Hide anonymous 9GAGGER posts
- Hide users with blue checkmarks
- Hide 'Promoted' posts*
- Hide posts by tags or words in the title*
- Firefox support** 
 
*new version is awaiting review  [10/02/2023 21:50 CET]\
**Firefox addon still awaiting reviw [10/02/2023 21:50 CET]


## Soon (maybe idk)
- Mobile support***
- Dark mode
- nice UI

***Firefox mobile supports browser addons, waiting to see if I could register it as a mobile compatible addon
