Recently it has become apparant that 9gag is plagued by bots and spammers, so I created this simple extention to remove them from our feeds.\
This extention doesn't block any account but simply hides the posts.

[Download on the Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/9gag-post-filter/ajkipkkhchaaccpbpkclolpebkgbmodl)\
[Download on the Firefox addons website](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9gag-post-filter/)*\

## Features

- Show days next to the username on every post
- Hide users with less than X amount of days
- Hide anonymous 9GAGGER posts
- Hide users with blue checkmarks
- Hide 'Promoted' posts
- Hide posts by tags or words in the title
- Firefox support** 
 

**Firefox addon still awaiting review [10/02/2023 21:50 CET]


## Soon (maybe idk)
- Mobile support***
- sus accounts list****
- Dark mode
- nice UI

***Firefox mobile supports browser addons, waiting to see if I could register it as a mobile compatible addon\
\
**** with every accout age check, the code also pulls basic info about the last 10 posts that were posted by the user,\
     by checking if the user posts too frequently, we could mark that user as a possible bot or spammer.


## Feedback

Feel free to suggest any changes or improvements to my code
