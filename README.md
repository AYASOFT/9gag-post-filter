# 9gag-post-filter

Recently it has become apparant that 9gag is plagued by bots and spammers, so I created this simple extention to remove them from our feeds.\
This extention doesn't block any account but simply hides the posts.




## Features

- Show days next to the username on every post
- Hide users with less than X amount of days
- Hide anonymous 9GAGGER posts
- Hide users with blue chackmarks


## Soon (maybe idk)

- Firefox support
- Dark mode
- More filters


## Feedback

Feel free to suggest any changes or improvements to my code
